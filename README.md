This is my Assignment 2 for the WIT [Web Development](https://tutors-design.netlify.com/course/wit-hdip-comp-sci-2020-web-development.netlify.com) module.

Full gym tracking functionality, including separate member and tainer sections.

Members can sign up, sign in, view details of all assessments, as well as some
analytics such as BMI measurement and category, ideal body weight indication, and weight
trend per assessment (after 2nd assessment). Members can also edit their own details.

Trainers can sign up, sign in, view all existing members, view individual member assessments
and analytics, add and remove assessments and comment on individual assessments. Trainers
can also delete members from the system.

For demo purposes, two members and one trainer have been preloaded into the system.

Demo member emails: draken@worldexplore.org or mario@mariobrosplumbing.it

Demo trainer email: sierra117@unsc.org

For ease, all passwords are "password".

The application has been deployed to: [link to come]
